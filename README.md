# IBM Machine Learning with Python course 
In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

We use the training set to build an accurate model. Then we use the test set to report the accuracy of the model

We use the following algorithm:

*   K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
*   Decision Tree
*   Support Vector Machine
*   Logistic Regression
